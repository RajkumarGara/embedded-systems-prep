# embedded-systems-prep

Comprehensive embedded systems preparation — C core concepts, data structures & algorithms, operating systems, embedded drivers, system design, and more.

The `c_core/` section now keeps its reference docs directly in one folder for faster browsing, including C fundamentals plus focused C++ notes.

## Build

Run all commands from the repository root:

```sh
make        # build
make run    # run the default program
make clean  # clean build artifacts
```

Run a specific program:

```sh
